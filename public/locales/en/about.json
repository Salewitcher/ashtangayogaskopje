      "text": "Ashtanga yoga or eight-limbed yoga is a form of classical Indian yoga which follows a set sequence of yoga postures broken down into 4 levels. Yoga students begin practicing the basics of the 1st series, and only advance further after they fully master the 1st series of yoga postures in the Ashtanga method. The Ashtanga Yoga Primary Series or Yoga Chikitsa (yoga therapy) is designed to create heat and eliminate accumulated toxins. The Ashtanga Yoga Method is comprised of three main elements: deep breaths, (abdominal) muscle-locks, and focused gaze. The postures are connected through vinyasas which help to retain the heat in the body and connect the breath to each movement. The benefits are a clear and calmer mind, cleansed body, and healthy spirit."
